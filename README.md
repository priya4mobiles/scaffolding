## Software used



### `Enzyme, Jest`
Jest and Enzyme are different but complimentary tools, that integrate well together to provide flexible and creative testing abilities

### `Jest`
Jest acts as a test runner, assertion library, and mocking library.
Jest also provides Snapshot testing, the ability to create a rendered ‘snapshot’ of a component 
and compare it to a previously saved ‘snapshot’.
The test will fail if the two do not match. 
Snapshots will be saved for you beside the test file that created them in an auto-generate __snapshots__ folder. 


### `react-test-renderer`
use a test renderer to quickly generate a serializable value for your React tree.
